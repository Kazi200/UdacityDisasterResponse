# UdacityDisasterResponse
Udacity - Data Scientist Nanodegree - Project 2

The purpose of the project is to be able to categroise messages received in a disaster scenario so that disaster relief agencies are able to respond appropriately.  

The project itself has 3 components:
1. The ETL Pipeline component, which serves to load the data, clean it and store it.
2. The ML Pipeline component, which serves to classify the messages by using machine learning techniques.
3. The Web App component, which surfaces the process on the web to be visualised and used to classify individual messages.
